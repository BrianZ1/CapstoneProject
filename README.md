# CapstoneProject

This is the repository for my Champlain College Capstone project.

The folder "code_old_word" is no longer being updated. The code relevent to
the project is moved to the code folder in mysite.

pip install -r requirements.txt <br />

  pip install --upgrade lxml <br />
  pip install cssselect <br />
  nltk.download('punkt') <br />
  nltk.download('stopwords') <br />
  nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') <br />
