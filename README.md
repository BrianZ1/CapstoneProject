# CapstoneProject

This is the repository for my Champlain College Capstone project.

The folder "code_old_word" is no longer being updated. The code relevent to
the project is moved to the code folder in mysite.

pip install -r requirements.txt
may need to run these commands as well:
  nltk.download('punkt')
  nltk.download('stopwords')
  nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
